		<h2>Revisiting Accessibility for 2017 Section 508 Compliance</h2>
		<p>In 2017, the U.S. Governement revised the <a href="http://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies">IT
				Accessibility Laws and Policies</a> requirements for section 508 Accessibily which
			covers web browser based pages and applications.<br /><br />
			<cite>In this final rule, the Access Board is updating its existing Electronic and Information Technology
				Accessibility 
				Standards under section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, ("508 Standards"), as well as our
				Telecommunications
				Act Accessibility Guidelines under Section 255 of the Communications Act of 1934 ("255 Guidelines").
				Given the
				passage of nearly two decades since their issuance, the existing 508 Standards and 255 Guidelines are in
				need of a
				"refresh" in several important respects. This final rule is intended to, among other things, address
				advances in
				information and communication technology that have occurred since the guidelines and standards were
				issued in 1998
				and 2000 respectively, harmonize with accessibility standards developed by standards organizations
				worldwide in
				recent years, and ensure consistency with the Board's regulations that have been promulgated since the
				late 1990s.
				The Revised 508 Standards and 255 Guidelines support the access needs of individuals with disabilities,
				while also
				taking into account the costs of providing accessible information and communication technology to
				Federal agencies,
				as well as manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment.</cite>

				href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/18/2017-00395/information-and-communication-technology-ict-standards-and-guidelines">Information
				and Communication Technology (ICT) Standards and Guidelines</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The final rules governing the 508 Standards became effecting January 18, 2019 after more than a decade of <a
				href="https://www.veterans.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/BVA%20Annual%20Testimony%202014.pdf">discussion and
				public debate</a>. Government agencies such as the Department of Veterans are covered by the 508
			Standards. Failure to comply can lead to significant penalties, ref: <a
				href="https://getadaaccessible.com/ada-compliance-law-and-penalities/">reportedly</a> with fines up to
			$55,000 for the first violation and $110,000 for each subsequent violation".
		</p>
		<p>
			For web developers (as opposed to, for example, elevator builders), the key requirement is that someone who
			is disabled can use the product. This can be done using the normal pages for the application or an alternate
			interface. The <a
				href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/25-508-standards/720-questions-answers-about-section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act-amendments-of-1998#19)">508
				Standards define Accessibility</a>: "In general, an information technology system is accessible to
			people with disabilities if it can be used in a variety of ways that do not depend on a single sense or
			ability". The key requirements for web builders are to enable blind users to navigate the page and
			effectively use the screen reader.</p>
		<p>
			The defacto standard screen reader technology in use today is <a
				href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">JAWS</a>, a paid prodcut from Freedom
			scientific. Prior to 2019, JAWS had problems with most browsers except Firefox, so many blind users have
			adopted JAWS with Firefox. In 2018, however, Firefox introduced the Quantum-based browser, and <a
				href="http://blog.freedomscientific.com/firefoxesr/">this version would not work with older versions of
				JAWS</a>. In 2019, JAWS was updated to work with Firefox Quantum. Thus, in 2019 the prefered screen
			reader configuration is generally Microsoft Windows with JAWS 2019 and Firefox ESR 62+ (Quantum). Internet
			Explorer 11 is often also required as some organizations prevent introduction of new software including
			browsers; however, Microsoft has announced that Internet Explorer is adopting webkit so it is likely that
			the JAWS implementation for Internet Explorer will change.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final rule specifies that web sites and applications must follow the <a
				href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0</a> standard from w3.org. Specifically the keyboard
			accessibility protocols of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/">WAI-ARIA, the
				Accessible Rich Internet Applications suite of web standards (ARIA)</a> must be provided, including
			maintaining a sensible tab order, adding section tags for navigation, and <a
				href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard-accessible">specifying "aria" tags and
				properties</a> on the web page elements.
		</p>
		<p>
			Implementers would follow practices of proper <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#usage">ARIA Usage</a>
			including:
			<pre>
ARIA Roles: &lt;li role="menuitem"&gt;Open file... &lt;/l&gt;
ARIA States and Properties: &lt;li role="menuitemcheckbox" aria-checked="true"&gt;Sort by Last Modified&lt;/li&gt;
ARIA Styles: [aria-checked="true"] { font-weight: bold; }
			 [aria-checked="true"]::before { background-image: url(checked.gif); }
</pre>
			Many websites such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">Mozilla</a>,
			<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-use-aria-effectively-with-html5/">SitePoint</a> and <a
				href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/">Google</a> offer
			tips and examples of enabling accessiblity using WP-ARIA.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the laws in place from 2017 governing all U.S. Government software, and with similar requirements
			adoped by many other governments and corporations, and because it is the right thing to do, the requirement
			to implement accessibility protocols is imperative for all major software endeavors.
